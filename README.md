I am a mechanical engineer.
I don't have much experience with coding websites but I have a lot of downtime at work and wanted to learn something new.
Please enjoy my random assortment of games and maps and whatnot.
The Narnia game is my first attempt at coding a text based RPG. It is heavily based on C.S Lewis' Narnia series. Specifically _The Magician's Nephew_ and _The Silver Chair_.
