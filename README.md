I am a mechanical engineer.
I don't have much experience with coding websites but I have a lot of downtime at work and wanted to learn something new.
This is my first attempt at coding a text based RPG. It is heavily based on C.S Lewis' Narnia series. Specifically _The Magician's Nephew_ and _The Silver Chair_.
